# WARNING

This a fork of the initial project with only a little fix to make it
work with Seamonkey.
Note that only CSV exports can be imported. XML don't (Parse error).

When I say "can", it means "it worked for me".

# About
## Password Backup Tool
Export and import passwords saved in Seamonkey browser.  
Only previous CSV exports from other Firefox-based browsers have been
tested.

This might break badly in many ways. Make backups of your export/import
and your current browser profile.  
You've been warned.
